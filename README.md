# Self-Assessment
    This bootcamp was one of the most unique experiences I have ever had. It taught me to be more open-minded and learn different skills, to be more motivated towards solving real problems, and also opened a  new passion door for me. I came to this bootcamp with no programming experience and I am leaving with more than I couldâ€™ve learned within a year if I were to be in UCSD. One of my previous job experiences was where I was a  genetics data analyst. I was analyzing genomic data whilst using a programming software developed by Thermofisher. My role included writing algorithms for the programming team, but did not involve me doing any coding whatsoever. It is the coding that was the special sauce or the meat of the project. I had no experience whatsoever, and would often get lost whenever having someone explain to me how the programming would enable the appropriate outcome. I am very grateful that I took the opportunity to be part of this bootcamp. The bootcamp opened a whole new door for me; a new hobby, a new passion, as well as a new innovative road. While being in this bootcamp for 6 months, there are certain areas I would like to improve on.
	One area that needs focusing is on time management. Coding can be a strenuous job and doing it all in a short span of time can be quite frustrating especially for someone who just barely started coding. Being able to manage time wisely and take beneficial notes is what needs to be done more in the future. This would enable me to not only get a better sense of what I am doing, but also would help me reach out to the instructors and get beneficial feedback from them. The key idea here is to be a sponge and observe as much knowledge as possible. Not managing time wisely will prevent me from acquiring knowledge and developing skills. Next time, I need to strategize what tasks I will be doing on such and such a particular set of days. 
	The second area that I need to focus on more is learning on how to learn. Coding is a whole different field, a whole different experience. Therefore, to absorb knowledge would take a different route. Coding is not like biology where one would just memorize and expect everything to turn out right. Rather coding takes multiple routes into acquiring results. Throughout this bootcamp, I have witnessed multiple times of myself getting errors whilst typing the exact coding as given in the modules. The goal was to understand those errors and how to fix them. Errors were actually the stepping points to having myself develop further skills. Each error opens a whole different door of knowledge. Therefore, my future plans are not to only stop at this bootcamp. I plan to participate further in other bootcamps and also use other means of resource in order to learn and thrive. Different instructors may have different ways of coding and getting the outcome they are looking for. 
	In conclusion, this bootcamp definitely paved the pathway for myself to take upon further challenges on solving real life problems. What should be focused more on is how to learn. This bootcamp taught me how to learn and solve problems. For sure the learning method will be different for other data science bootcamps and my goal is to acquire those learning methods in order to understand, and in order to execute the knowledge being taken.
